# tronferno-mcu-bin

MCU firmware binary for [tronferno-mcu](https://github.com/zwiebert/tronferno-mcu).


## ESP8266

You need an ESP8266 board with USB connector. The firmware is build for a board with 4 MByte flash.


### Usage on Windows

  * download the files
  * open command prompt and change to directory containing the flash.bat file
  * connect ESP8266 to PC via USB cable
  * find out which COM port the ESP is connected to (e.g. by device manager) 
  * run: flash.bat COMxx


### Usage on Linux

  * download the files
  * open command prompt and change to directory containing the flash.sh file
  * connect ESP8266 to PC via USB cable
  * find out which serial port the ESP is connected to (ls /dev/ttyUSB* ) 
  * (install python, if not already installed)
  * run: . flash.sh /dev/ttyUSBx


 ### Problems
  * Should only be flashed on the 4 MByte variant of ESP8266. 
  * Flash mode is set to DIO for better compatibilty (-fm dio). I bought some "integrated" boards, which will not work with -fm qio.
  

## ATmega328P

### Usage on Windows

  * download the files
  * open command prompt and change to directory containing the avr_flash.bat file
  * connect ISP-flasher to PC via USB cable and to ATmega328p via ISP cable
  * find out which COM port the flasher hardware is connected to (e.g. by device manager) 
  * (install avrdude and add it to path)
  * run: avr_flash.bat COMxx


### Usage on Linux

  * download the files
  * open command prompt and change to directory containing the avr_flash.sh file
  * connect ISP-flasher to PC via USB cable and to ATmega328p via ISP cable
  * find out which serial port the flasher hardware is connected to (e.g. ls /dev/ttyACM* ) 
  * (install avrdude and add it to path)
  * run: . avr_flash.sh /dev/ttyACMx


### Problems
  * the Linux package "modemmanager" may get in the way of accessing /dev/ttyACMx . I uninstalled that thing with "sudo apt remove modemmanager" because I don't have a modem and it was pretty annoying. Can be also disabled temporarily (use google).
